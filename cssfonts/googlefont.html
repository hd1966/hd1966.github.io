        <span>Tektur</span>
        Tektur is a constructed typeface featuring octagonal outlines and rectangular<br>
         counters. This rudimentary principle is applied where rounds are typically found,<br>
          but most of the diagonals are left intact which helps preserve good readability and<br>
           a familiar stance. The x-height is set high and ascenders are aligned with the cap <br>
           height allowing for compact typesetting. Tektur is created by Adam Jagosz.<br>
        </div>
